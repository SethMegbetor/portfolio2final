Absolute position:
For Absolute positioning you are adding the margin in relation to the parent element or container. An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). 

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

centering elements with css

text-align: center;

h1 {
  /* margin-top: 0; */
  width: 10%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
